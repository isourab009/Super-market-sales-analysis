# Super-market-sales-analysis

This project involved analyzing a [dataset](supermarket_sales - Sheet1.csv) of supermarket sales to gain insights into the company's sales performance by various categories. The data was first cleaned and preprocessed using Python's pandas library ( Python code(to analyse and visualise).py ), and then analyzed using various statistical and data visualization techniques.

The analysis focused on several key areas, including Sales Performance by Product Category, Sales Performance by Location, Sales Performance by Customer Demographics, and Sales by Payment Method. For each of these areas, various graphs, charts, and tables were created to provide a clear and comprehensive picture of the company's sales performance.

Overall, the project (super market sales analysis .pdf ) demonstrated how data analysis can be used to gain valuable insights into a company's performance, and how these insights can be used to guide strategic decision-making and marketing efforts to optimize sales and profitability.

The code for this project, along with the dataset used, has been uploaded to a GitHub repository for reference and further analysis.
